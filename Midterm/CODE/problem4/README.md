# Problem 4 - AES S-Box Design and Evaluation

## Overview

This implementation replaces the standard AES irreducible polynomial with `p2(x) = x⁸ + x⁵ + x³ + x + 1` and constructs an S-box using:
1. Multiplicative inverse in GF(2⁸) defined by `p2(x)`
2. Affine transformation matrix `M` built by cyclic rotation of vector `0b11110000`
3. Affine constant `C` chosen to satisfy cryptographic criteria

## Approach

### 1. Field Arithmetic (GF(2⁸))
- A custom multiplication function `gf_mul()` is implemented using polynomial multiplication and modular reduction by `p2(x) = 0x12B`.
- Multiplicative inverses are computed by brute-force search via `gf_inv()` over the field GF(2⁸).

### 2. Affine Transformation
- A circulant matrix `M` is generated by cyclically shifting the binary vector `[1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1]`.
- For each input `x`, the output `y = M · x⁻¹ ⊕ C` is computed bitwise to construct the S-box.

### 3. Constant Selection
- All 256 possible values of affine constant `C` (0–255) were exhaustively tested.
- A valid `C0` was selected such that the resulting S-box is bijective and has **no fixed points**.

### 4. Cryptographic Evaluation
The resulting S-box was evaluated against the following criteria:

# | Criterion                | Target              | Result
--|--------------------------|---------------------|-------------------------
 1| Bijectivity              | 256 unique values   | 256 unique
 2| Non-linearity            | ≥112                | 112
 3| Strict Avalanche (SAC)   | ~50% bit flips      | 50.6%
 4| Differential Uniformity  | ≤4                  | 4
 5| Linear-approx. bias      | ≤16                 | 16
 6| Algebraic degree         | 7                   | 7
 7| Fixed-point count        | 0                   | 0
